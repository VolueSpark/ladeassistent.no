# Ladeassistent

Ladeassistent is a example project mainly focused on showcasing various ways to render data from the Spark API.
It can be run locally by following the instructions below, or you can visit it [here](https://www.ladeassistent.no).

## Getting Started

### Create a .env.local file

Before running the project you have to create and populate a .env.local with variables found in the [.env.template](./.env.template) file. The `PLATFORM_CLIENT_ID` and `PLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET` needs to contain your API credentials.

### Run the project using yarn

```bash
#   Install dependencies
yarn
#   Start server
yarn dev
```

#### Alternatively

Run the project using npm by first deleting the yarn.lock file, then run the following commands

```bash
#   Install dependencies
npm install
#   Start the server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to reach the local dev server.

## Disclaimer

There are three `internal` folders: `pages/api/internal`, `pages/internal` and `src/components/Internal`. These should be deleted as they rely on internal API keys used for testing new features. They won't stop the project from running, but any interaction with these routes will likely result in error messages. This is a temporary solution.
